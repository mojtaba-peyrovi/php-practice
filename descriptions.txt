php practitioner=================
part3: in order to see the code on browser we can define a server like 
this:   php -S localhost:8888
-----------------------
part4: PHP and Html: 
query builder:  when we pass ?key=value  in url ==> we need to define that variable in php document with a SUPERGLOBAL variable like this:
url: localhost:8080?name=moji
in php file: $name = $_GET['name']
===> another syntax for <?php echo    -----> <?=
htmlspecialchars($_GET['name'])  --> is a function that sanitizes the code viewers may add to url to manipulate our code. this function will convert that to a string and it wont be executed.   
------------------------
part5: separate php logic from the html view. 
require:  is a function that pulls everything from the view to php file and links the view and php together. (separation of concerns)
